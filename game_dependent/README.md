I, Dason Woodhouse (Dwood15), do not endorse piracy, and do believe that to every extent possible, users should be on the highest version.
 
Unfortunately, over the past 10+ years stubbz the zombie, halo pc, halo custom edition, have all been updated and patched to varying degrees, leaving various mods for the amazing blam! game engine in the dust.
 
This is why these versions will exist. For choosing a game target, as of May 6, 2018, only 1.10 of the halo custom edition _game_ is supported. I look forward to finding out how to add full support for the Halo Editing Kit and Halo PC in the coming future.
