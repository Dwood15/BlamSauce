#BlamSauce

This code was taken from Kornman00 (Sean Cooper)'s BlamLib c++ project.

The goal here is to eventually rewrite Open Sauce into a form which is understandable and useable by the mere mortal.

Actually, 99.9% of the reason for this port is so I can have a second codebase to split Tempera between.

Thankfully, Open Sauce is GPLv3 Open Source. As such, all current and future versions of CppBlamSauce will be open source.

Primary changes: 

  * C++17 support.
  * CmakeLists file
  * DirectX include search via cmake folder.
  * Formatting upgrades.
  
  
  * _No Boost_ 
  * **_NO BOOST_** 
  ##NO BOOST
  
 ~~ *ahem* ~~
  
  * No Visual Studio Solution Files required
  * Potential for MinGW GCC support, maybe. Submit PR?
  * Readability improvements and removal of some abusively obfuscating macros.

  Not everything from Open Sauce has been ported. This will take some time to complete, due to the sheer size of BlamLib. The intent, however, is to port BlamLib in whole to this project.
